8000000/(256*4*16) = 488
2400000/(256*4*16)


To set the frequency to 1 kHz, use the formula to set the period appropriately. The number use use in the open() function will depend on your prescalars. 1 kHz means a period of 1 millisecond or 1000 microseconds. Tosc is 0.125 microseconds. If you set the prescalar to 1:16, an input of 125 should give you the frequency you want. â€“


Frequency is the a measure of the time required for a signal to complete 1 full cycle.


(actually, 1 over the measure of)

Period and Duty

- 50hz/s = (20ms period) frequency
- Duty Cycle of 0.5ms to 2.5ms
  - 0.5ms == 0 degrees
  - 1.5ms == 90 degrees
  - 2.5ms == 180 degrees
